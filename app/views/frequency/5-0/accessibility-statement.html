    <p class="govuk-body">This service is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There's a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility-statement">accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This statement only applies to the Manage your State Pension service, available at <a href="https://www.manage-state-pension.service.gov.uk"> https://www.manage-state-pension.service.gov.uk</a></p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this service</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by Department for Work and Pensions. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">We've also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this service is</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">This service uses common styles, patterns and components from the GOV.UK Design System which are widely regarded as accessible.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this service are not fully accessible.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the user does not do anything for [##] minutes, a modal dialog opens to warn the user they are about to be signed out. This modal dialog uses dynamic text that counts down to zero. When using the Hover Text feature of macOS, this text does not appear in the text entry location. This is because the text is marked up in a way to stop a screen reader reading it aloud every second.</p>
