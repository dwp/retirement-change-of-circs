        <li>Allowing access into the GYSP service from a public link online</li>
        <li>Assuming change of address will be the first feature that can be accessed by both GySP and Legacy citizens</li>
        <li>The eligibility checker has been removed from the journey now that address will be available to all citizens. This includes the screens 'Have you received a letter', "date of birth", and screens showing the result of the eligibility checker informing citizens what they can do in the service
        <li>MySP start page has a bulletted list of things you 'may' be able to do if you are born after 1955 as we cant be 100% sure
        <li>There is a small number of people who's birth date is out of sync on our systems due to an equalisation period so they may not get the experience they expect. The language around what additional things a citizen can do is a little vague to account for this. This is something we cannot get around unless we have an accurate date of birth for all of our citizens
        <li>The majority of citizens will be on legacy so the additional features can only be used by 17% of Pensioners which doesnt account for citizens who dont have access to online services so this figure may be less
        <li>The best scenario is that a citizen on GySP reaches the MySP dashboard to find out they can do more than a change of address
        <li>The worst scenario is that a citizen on Legacy reaches the MySP dashboard to find out they can do a change of address.
